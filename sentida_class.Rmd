#select a leader from one of the Danish political parties (https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/resultater/folketingsvalg). From fv_all make a new dataframe including only tweets mentioning this person. 
#E.g.: paludan <- filter(fv_all, str_detect(fvhash$text, "Paludan") == T)



### You might want to do some preprocessing of the text here. str_remove_all() is cute, tolower() is cool, str_replace_all() is sexy. Make the tweets lowercase and remove all numbers (Major hint alert: str_remove_all(paludan$text,[:digit:]))



#Make a new row in the dataframe with sentiment score of every tweet mentioning this person (e.g use lapply() or make a loop if you dare)
?lapply
```


```{r}
#what is his/her mean sentiment score?
###Bonus: What is their mean sentiment score per day? !WARNING ADVANCED PLEASE SKIP! lifesaver: aggregate()




#Compare your political leader to one from another party





#Did the parties who won less mandates than the last election have a worse sentiment score than the rest?




#Are there any correlations between sentiment score and amount of favourites/retweets?
